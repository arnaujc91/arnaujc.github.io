We have a set of events and we want to fit a probability distribution to describe these
events. First we have to pick a probability distribution, and second we need to estimate 
which are the paremeters that fit the data the best.

Fitting the parameters can be done using Bayesian inference. Choosing the model will be 
up to you and the success of it will depend on your intuition.

For the sake of simplicity let's assume we are throwing coins and we want to record
some data to see if the coin is biased or not.
