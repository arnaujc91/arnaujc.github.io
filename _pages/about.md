I am a theoretical physicist who switched to data science and software development. I did my bachelor's degree in Barcelona at the [UAB](https://www.uab.cat/) and my Master of Science degree at the [LMU](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) in Munich. 

Passionate about deep learning and in my free time I have contributed to libraries like [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). My main programming language is Python and the libraries I use more frequently are: PyTorch, Fastai, Scikitlearn, Pandas, Numpy or Tensorflow among others. Furthermore I have some experience with Java, C and a tiny bit of front end technologies.

I have worked both as a data scientist (NLP + computer vision) and as a software developer (Java + Angular). You can see the results of a face swapping algorithm that we developed at TNG [here](https://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/Software-ermoeglicht-Deep-Fakes-in-Echtzeit-4500193.html). Currently I am working as a Freelancer and searching for a Data Scientist position.
